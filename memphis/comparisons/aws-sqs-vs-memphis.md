# AWS SQS vs Memphis

## What is AWS SQS?

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. Amazon SQS offers common constructs such as dead-letter queues and cost allocation tags. It provides a generic web services API that you can access using any programming language that the AWS SDK supports.

## **What is Memphis.dev?**

**Memphis** is a next-generation messaging queue.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire ecosystem that enables fast and reliable development of next-generation event-driven use cases.

Memphis.dev enables building next-generation applications that require large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

\*Available for Memphis cloud users

### **Data Flow**&#x20;

SQS uses a distinct, bounded data flow. Messages are created and sent by the producer and received by the consumer.&#x20;

Memphis uses an unbounded data flow, with the key-value pairs continuously streaming to the assigned station.

### **Data Usage**

AWS SQS is best for transactional data, such as order formation, placement, and user requests.&#x20;

Memphis works great for transactional and operational data like process operations, auditing and logging statistics, and system activity.

### **Message retention**&#x20;

AWS SQS pushes messages to consumers. These messages are removed from the queue once they are processed and acknowledged.&#x20;

Memphis is a log. It uses continuous messages, which stay in the station (queue) until the retention period expires.

### Multi-tenancy

**AWS SQS** doesn't support multi-tenancy but through a lambda function, required to be code and managed by the user that acts as a router.

**Memphis** supports multi-tenancy using namespaces which offers a complete separation from connections, producers, consumers, security, dedicated dashboard, including node selection.

### **Observability**&#x20;

Some level of observability can be received by using 3rd party apps like Cloudwatch/Datadog/New Relic. To understand the full path of a message, it is required to use AWS X-Ray and add some headers to each client. Notifications can be achieved by building a dedicated event queue with lambda triggers. Some alarms and triggers must be defined over 3rd party apps to enable lag identifications and latency in real-time.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-22 at 14.38.55.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Memphis offers full Infra-to-cluster-to-data GUI-based observability, monitoring, real-time message tracing, and notifications embedded inside the management layer, including self-healing policies based on the defined events.\

## TCO comparison

### Defining a cost model for data streaming

In this economic climate, costs are top of mind for everyone.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) should be a primary consideration when evaluating the Return on Investment (ROI) of adopting a new software platform. TCO is the blended cost of deploying, configuring, securing, productionizing, and operating the software over its expected lifetime, including all infrastructure, personnel, training, and subscription costs.&#x20;

For this comparison, we define TCO as a combination of the following components:

1. Implementation: The cost of implementing a new streaming technology
2. Infrastructure: The cost of computing and storage, in this case on AWS

For the infrastructure cost comparison, we ran benchmarks to compare the performance of AWS SQS against Memphis.

### Implementation costs

Oftentimes, there is a misconception that cloud services are a turnkey solution. \
Here are some of the missing components that will need to be constructed when using AWS SQS -&#x20;
