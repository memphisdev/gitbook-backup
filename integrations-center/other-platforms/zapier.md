# Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com) is an online automation tool that connects your apps and services. You can connect two or more apps to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

With Zapier / Memphis integration, you create automation workflows that will be triggered by records ingested in a Memphis station or to produce events from a Zapier "Zap" (Workflow) to a Memphis station for further processing.

Great for auditing, notifications, webhooks that might require custom handling, and in-house applications and clients that are not available through Zapier.

#### Capabilities

* Trigger a zap when a new message/record gets ingested into a Memphis station
* Produce a message/record

### Getting Started with Zapier

Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/APP/integrations) account, and from there, you can jump right in.&#x20;
