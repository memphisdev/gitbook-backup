# Overview

More and more organizations are leveraging real-time events Serving multiple use cases and a growing number of in-house customers with real-time events than ever before.

Data is constantly evolving and new business requirements continually arise. Making it hard for devs and data teams to keep pace and adapt their pipelines.&#x20;

Here are the usual roadblocks to deploying new event-driven features:

* Implement some SDK and best practices
* Error handling
* Monitoring and logging
* Performance optimizations
* Deployment and integration
* Scale
* HA and FT

And then a new use case arises :(

It's not scalable, no code reuse, it takes time you don't have, and it's hard to debug.
