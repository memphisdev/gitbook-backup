# v1.4.2 - latest

## ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* Introducing new [connectors](../../memphis-broker/concepts/connectors.md): Redis (a key-value database) and Memphis sink connectors are now available.
* Enhanced control for cloud users over the garbage collection of disconnected clients.
* Consumer client garbage collection will preserve offset management, even if all consumers are disconnected.
* [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../../memphis/concepts/security.md#role-based-access-control-rbac) implemented for client-type users.
* [Memphis CLI](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-cli) now includes features to run benchmarks.
* The user interface will display notifications for clients that require SDK version updates.
* A dark mode feature has been added for a better UI experience.
* Memphis Functions has entered its Beta phase.
* Updates to SDK versions: Node.js SDK has been updated to version 1.3.0, Go SDK to 1.3.0, Python SDK to 1.3.0, and .Net SDK to 0.7.0.

### ![:bug:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f41b.png) Fixed bugs

* Resolved an issue where creating a schema from the SDK did not generate a new version when the schema already existed.
* Fixed a bug where resending unacknowledged messages from the UI resulted in sending the message twice to Node.js-based clients.
* Corrected a problem where defining a station with more than one partition as a dead-letter queue for another station was previously not feasible.

## ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* Clients using older versions may encounter difficulties when attempting to connect with a user account that has restricted access to stations (due to Role-Based Access Control).
* Authentication using connection tokens for the broker is currently non-functional.
* The Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive when storage capacity hits 100%, and remains so until the storage is reduced by at least 10%.
* Establishing a connection with the broker is slower when connecting via localhost (using port forwarding).
* The Slack integration occasionally hits the API rate limit set by Slack, resulting in the loss of some notifications.
