# Overview

## Introduction

Organizations shift to process events and logs on the fly before they reach the data warehouse and adopt an event-driven type of architecture, but the environment and data are constantly changing - development teams are struggling to keep pace, and also development should be done with much less effort and much more agility.

#### Struggles on the way there -&#x20;

1. Hard to develop new stream processing flows.
2. Highly coupled code to a specific flow or type of events.
3. No code reuse or share.
4. Debug, troubleshoot, and fix.
5. Code evolvement.

#### The problems with existing solutions -&#x20;

* It is forcing devs to use SQL or other dedicated vendor-locking languages.
* Do not support custom logic.
* Increase infrastructure complexity at scale.
* Do not enable code reuse or share.
* It still takes a significant amount of time to build a real-time app/pipeline.

## Memphis Functions

&#x20;Memphis platform comprises four decoupled components:&#x20;

1. Memphis Broker as the engine and storage layer.
2. Schemaverse for schema management and enforcement.
3. Memphis Functions for serverless stream processing.
4. Memphis Connect for pulling and pushing data using ready-to-use connectors.

Memphis functions enable data analysts, developers, and data engineers to collaborate and process, transform, and enrich ingested events “on the fly” in a serverless, low-code/no-code manner, meaning without boilerplate or infrastructure in any supported language, including Go, Python, JS, .NET, Java, SQL, and more.
